# WebGL Rubik's Cube based on Three.js
This project implements a WebGL Rubik's Cube based on Three.js. 
The current implementation progress:
- [x] Basic 3D Scene with simple objects.
- [x] Basic 3-Level Rubik's Cube.
- [x] Orbit Control to support moving view points.
- [ ] Cube Shuffling.
- [ ] Cube rotation on mouse event.
- [ ] Automatic solving the Rubik's Cube.
- [ ] More efficient algorithm.
- [ ] Follow-up: Timer, Step Counter.
