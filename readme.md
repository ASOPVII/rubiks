# WebGL Rubik's Cube based on Three.js
This project implements a WebGL Rubik's Cube based on Three.js.
 
The current implementation progress:
- [x] Basic 3D Scene with simple objects.
- [x] Basic 3-Level Rubik's Cube.
- [x] Orbit Control to support moving view points.
- [x] Cube rotation on mouse event.
- [x] Cube Shuffling.
- [x] Automatic solver(LBL) for the Rubik's Cube.
- [x] More efficient algorithm: CFOP implemented in Python.
- [x] Communication between Python and HTML via Flask.
